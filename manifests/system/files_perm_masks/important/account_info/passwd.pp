#	  If the /etc/passwd file is writable by a group-owner or the world the risk of
#   its compromise is increased. The file contains the list of accounts on the system
#   and associated information, and protection of this file is critical for system
#   security.

#   include almalinux_hardening::system::files_perm_masks::important::account_info::passwd
class almalinux_hardening::system::files_perm_masks::important::account_info::passwd {
  if $almalinux_hardening::enable_important_account_passwd {
    file { '/etc/passwd':
      recurse => false,
      owner   => 'root',
      group   => 'root',
      mode    => '0644',
    }
