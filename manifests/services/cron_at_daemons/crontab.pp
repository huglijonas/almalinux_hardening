#	  Service configuration files enable or disable features of their respective
#   services that if configured incorrectly can lead to insecure and vulnerable
#   configurations. Therefore, service configuration files should have the correct
#   access rights to prevent unauthorized changes.
#
# @example
#   include almalinux_hardening::services::cron_at_daemons::crontab
class almalinux_hardening::services::cron_at_daemons::crontab {
  if $almalinux_hardening::enable_cron_crontab {
