# @rationale
#   Service configuration files enable or disable features of their respective
#   services that if configured incorrectly can lead to insecure and vulnerable
#   configurations. Therefore, service configuration files should be owned by the
#   correct group to prevent unauthorized changes.
#
# @example
#   include almalinux_hardening::services::ssh::permissions
class almalinux_hardening::services::ssh::permissions {
  if $almalinux_hardening::enable_ssh_permissions {
    file { '/etc/ssh/sshd_config':
      ensure  => file,
      recurse => false,
      owner   => 'root',
      group   => 'root',
      mode    => '0600'
    }
  }
